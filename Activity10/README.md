# Activity 10

## Assignment Details

> Run the following console application with the “Activity 10 Code.” This program should produce the union of two sets, but has several errors. Use a variety of debugging techniques to locate and correct the errors.
>
> NOTE: A set is a collection of like elements that does not contain any duplicates. The union of two sets is the set that contains all the elements in both sets. Formally:
>
> A union B = {x : x Î A or x Î B}
> read: A union B is the set of all x such that x is in A or x is in B
>
> Example: A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {2,4,6,8}, then A union B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8} (notice, no duplicates!)
>
> Debug the program. When you find an error, comment out the offending line, give an explanation of the error, write a corrected line, and include a screenshot of your program running with successful output.
