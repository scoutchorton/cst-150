> Calories from fat and Carbohydrates **in C# WITH A WINDOWS FORM**
>
> A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula:
>
> Calories from Fat = Fat Grams x 9
>
> Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates using the following formula:
>
> Calories from carbs = Carbs grams x 4
>
> Create an application that will make these calculations. In the application, you should have the following methods:
>
> **FatCalories** – This method should accept a number of fat grams as an argument and return the number of calories from that amount of fat.
>
> **CarbCalories** – This method should accept a number of carbohydrates grams as an argument and return the number of calories from that amount of carbohydrates.
