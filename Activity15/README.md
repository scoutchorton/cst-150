# Activity 15

## Assignment Details

> Create the Lucky Number application, shown in the “Activity 15 Possible Implementation.”  Your project can calculate Lucky Numbers any way you wish, but must include the following features:
>
> * Two forms, minimum. Each form should have a different title.
> * A programmatically populated control.
> * A control populated based on the selected item in another control.
> * An event that launches the second form.
> * A screenshot of your program running with successful output.
>
> As always, programming style, usability, and creativity matter!
